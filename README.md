## Credits

The origin version of this project is rewrote from [LSD](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd),
thanks so much to [@meain](https://github.com/meain) and [@Peltoche](https://github.com/Peltoche)
for developing and maintaining LSD.

Dilu is NOT a replacement for LSD, Dilu will focus more on network data accessing, multiple backend support,
while LSD will offer much more functions and accessibility on local file system.

The data accessibility is leveraging the power of [Apache OpenDAL](https://github.com/apache/incubator-opendal),
thanks so much to [@Xuanwo](https://github.com/Xuanwo) for developing and open-sourcing OpenDAL.
